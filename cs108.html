            <br>1) Write about your experience playing, what happened during play?
            <br>I played Astro Blaster. The graphics are definitely accurate in terms of displaying it as it would on an arcade machine. The graphics are simple; I can see all the lines and edges that create the images and backgrounds. This makes it feel very classic. During the play, I used the left and right keys to move the ship horizontally across the screen, and used the command (control) key to shoot at the objects attacking the ship. As the game progresses, the attackers change from moving vertically, horizontally, circularly, etc. They also begin traveling faster, causing me to inaccurately target them. Also, if I continuously shoot, my ship overheats and I must wait until it cools down to return shooting. Another skill that I have is slowing down the attackers, using the alt key. This allows me to accurately shoot them because they do not move as quickly. 
            <br>
            <br>2) How is it different playing on an emulator vs playing the game on the original hardware.
            <br> It is different from playing on an emulator mainly because of the keys. On the original hardware, usually there would be an analog to quickly and efficiently move the character. Using the right and left keys on an emulator does not allow a smooth movement when controlling the character. As a result, it can cause inaccurate shots when shooting at the targets. Another reason why it is different is because I can replay it as much as I want. There is no sense of spending my money on tokens. This leads me to become more reckless in my plays, losing more quickly and easier. If I was playing this on the original hardware, I would definitely be more careful because I do not want to waste another token. Overall, I think this emulator is great to bring back the classics for those who want to enjoy it for nostalgic sake.
