                <br> <b>How to play</b>
                <br>Every player starts off with 3 cards. During each player's turn, they draw a card and place a following card on the table. The cards can be: Keeper, New Rule, Goal, Creeper, and Action. 
                <br>To win the game, the player's keeper cards must match those that the Goal card requires. 
                <br>
                <br><b>Let's play!</b>
                <br>
                <br> <b>Devin</b> kicks off the game by playing the War keeper card. Everyone at this point is spectating and wondering "war..." Is this a dangerous move? We do not know.... 
                <br>
                <br><b>Sean</b> proceeds to follow with his own keeper card, Love.
                <br>
                <br><b>I</b> am unsure on what to do... so I play it safe and put down a keeper card, the Cross.
                <br>
                <br><b>Mohammad </b> plays a keeper card, Milk.
                <br>
                <br><b>Nicole</b> also plays another keeper card, Palm Tree.
                <br>
                <br><i>At this point in the game, there are 5 keeper cards on the table.</i> 
                <br>
                <br> <b>Devin</b> continues the keeper card chain and places Bread on the table.  
                <br>
                <br><b>Sean</b> is tired of all these keeper cards. He wants to make it interesting, so he sets down the goal of the game... The Brain. This means that "if no one has television on the table, the player with brain on the table wins."
                <br>
                <br><b>I</b> also switch it up and play the first action card. I play Jackpot, which means I get to draw an additional 3 cards.
                <br>                
                <br><img src="blog2_hand.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400"/> 
                <br><i>This is my current hand at this point in time... </i>
                <br>
                <br><b>Mohammad </b>decides to continue on playing a keeper card, Sleep.
                <br>
                <br><i>Now this is where it gets interesting. The next card intensifies the game...</i> 
                <br>
                <br><b>Nicole</b> draws a Werewolfcreeper card. The Werewolf card states that the player must pass this card to a person of their choosing and remove one of their keeper cards. She decides to attack Sean, turning him into a Werewolf and destroying his Love card.
                <br>
                <br><b>Devin</b> plays the action card: Discard and draw. He discards his whole hand and draws a new hand.
                <br>
                <br><b>Sean,</b> the current werewolf, attacks me, turns me into a Werewolf, and discards the Cross. His final move, he plays a keeper card, Death.  
                <br>
                <br><b>I,</b> decide to attack Mohammad, turn him into a Werewolf, and discard Sleep. I play a new Goal card, The Story of Jesus. This means the player with the Cross and Bible on the table wins. 
                <br>
                <br><i>But oh wait... the Cross was just destroyed... dun dun dun!!</i>
                <br>
                <br><b>Mohammad</b> passes the Werewolf card to Devin and destroys War. He plays the first new rule card: Hand Limit 1. This means all players must discard all of their cards and only have 1 card in their hand. 
                <br>
                <br><b>Nicole</b> plays a new rule card that overrides the first: Hand Limit Two. This means the players can have 2 cards in their hand.
                <br>
                <br><b>Devin</b> attacks Mohammad, turns him back into a Werewolf, and discards Milk. He plays an action card: Let's do that again!, which allows him to search through the discard pile and find a new action card to play immediately. He chooses Jackpot! He discards 2 card from his hand to follow the new rule and ends his turn. 
                <br>
                <br><b>Sean</b> plays a keeper card: Death. 
                <br>
                <br><b>I</b> play an action card: Empty the trash. This combines the discard pile with the draw pile. 
                <br>
                <br><b>Mohammad </b>discards another Keeper card: Peace from Devin and transfers the werewolf to him. He also plays a New Rule card: Poor Bonus. This rule states that if you have fewer keepers in play than everyone else, draw 1 extra card. In event of a tie, no player receives the bonus.
                <br>
                <br><i>Connie & Mohammad are tied at 0 so no one receives the bonus</i>
                <br>
                <br><b>Nicole</b> plays a Goal card: Peace (No War) 
                <br>
                <br><img src="blog2_table1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400"/>
                <br><i>What is currently on the table </i> 
                <br>
                <br><i>In previous round, Mohammad discarded Sean’s peace card, costing him the win</i>                  
                <br>
                <br><b>Devin</b> decides to save us all and plays an action: Destroy a Creeper. This Destroys the werewolf card.
                <br>
                <br><b>Sean</b> plays a keeper card: The Rocket. 
                <br>
                <br><b>I</b> play a Keeper card: Cookies. 
                <br>
                <br><b>Mohammad </b>gets to draw an additional card during his turn due to the Poor Bonus rule. He plays a new rule card: Party bonus. This states that if someone has the party on the table, everyone gets to draw and play 1 extra card during their turn.
                <br>
                <br><b>Nicole</b> plays a new rule card: Keeper limit. This states that you are only allowed have 3 keeper cards in play. If you have more, discard them.     
                <br>
                <br><b>Devin</b> plays a keeper card: Angry mob of villagers. If you have this on the table, during your turn you may movie it to another player and discard one of that player’s Keepers or Creepers.  
                <br>
                <br><b>Sean</b> plays goal: Jesus Loves You. The player with cross and love wins. 
                <br>
                <br><i>Too bad both love and the cross have been destroyed *sad reacts only*</i>
                <br>
                <br><b>I</b> play a keeper card: The Toaster
                <br>
                <br><b>Mohammad </b> plays an action card: Draw 3, play 2 of them. He Draws 3 cards and plays a new goal: To sleep or not to sleep and a keeper: Sleep. He discards the last card. 
                <br>
                <br><i>This move puts Mohammad close to winning, since he set up his goal and keeper card.</i>   
                <br>
                <br><i>However... </i>
                <br><b>Nicole</b> decides to play a new goal: Milk and Cookie. A player needs a milk and cookie card to win.
                <br>
                <br><i>I currently hold the Cookie card... I'm so close?!?! I MIGHT WIN?!?</i>
                <br>
                <br><b>Devin</b> plays an action: Jackpot. He draw 3 cards and discards 2 cards to reach rule limit 
                <br>
                <br><b>Sean</b> plays a keeper: The Star. 
                <br>
                <br><b>I</b> play a keeper: The Party.
                <br>
                <br><i>Party Bonus rule is now in effect</i> 
                <br><b>Everyone gets to draw and play 1 extra card during their turn</b>              
                <br>
                <br><b>Mohammad </b> plays an action: Let’s do that again. This allows him to search through discard pile and take any action or new rule and play it. He plays an action: Pandora’s Box. 
                <br>He begins drawing cards. He draws until he plays 3 new rules. The other cards are discarded. 
                <br>The first rule he plays is Play All. This means play all of the cards in your hand each turn.
                <br>The second rule he plays is Play 2. This overrides the first and means only play 2 cards per turn. 
                <br> The final rule he plays is Play 5. Each player draw 5 cards per turn. 
                <br>
                <br><i>Sadly this is where the game ends due to time constraints.</i>

                <br><i>The last round before we had to end our game abruptly. </i>
                <br>
                <br>The game was just getting interesting and intense. We had a lot of new rules on the table and were so close to reaching the goals. But this game is tough because a player can easily betray you and destroy your keeper cards or change the goal at any given moment.

            <br>
            <br>1) Write about your experience playing, what happened during play?
            <br>I played Astro Blaster. The graphics are definitely accurate in terms of displaying it as it would on an arcade machine. The graphics are simple; I can see all the lines and edges that create the images and backgrounds. This makes it feel very classic. During the play, I used the left and right keys to move the ship horizontally across the screen, and used the command (control) key to shoot at the objects attacking the ship. As the game progresses, the attackers change from moving vertically, horizontally, circularly, etc. They also begin traveling faster, causing me to inaccurately target them. Also, if I continuously shoot, my ship overheats and I must wait until it cools down to return shooting. Another skill that I have is slowing down the attackers, using the alt key. This allows me to accurately shoot them because they do not move as quickly. 
            <br>
            <br>2) How is it different playing on an emulator vs playing the game on the original hardware.
            <br> It is different from playing on an emulator mainly because of the keys. On the original hardware, usually there would be an analog to quickly and efficiently move the character. Using the right and left keys on an emulator does not allow a smooth movement when controlling the character. As a result, it can cause inaccurate shots when shooting at the targets. Another reason why it is different is because I can replay it as much as I want. There is no sense of spending my money on tokens. This leads me to become more reckless in my plays, losing more quickly and easier. If I was playing this on the original hardware, I would definitely be more careful because I do not want to waste another token. Overall, I think this emulator is great to bring back the classics for those who want to enjoy it for nostalgic sake.
